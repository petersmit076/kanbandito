# kanbandito
Kanban style planning app

I'm not a backend developer, by far.
I don't even consider myself a front-end developer.
I am just a guy with an idea and some free time.

I came up with the idea for "Kanbandito" because of Jira.
Jira is an awesome program but sometimes too extensive.
There are a lot of features that you won't use when you're just a 'small' company.
So I want create my own project planning app.

Not because I need to (there are alternatives to Jira) but because I want to, I want build a real cool, easy to use open source
project planning app.
Everyone who is willing to contribute is appreciated!
